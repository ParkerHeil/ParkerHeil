Hi, my name is Parker Heil, i'm a second year student in a three-year Game Development program in Ontario Canada. 
I'm interested in classical music and art, and enjoy learning new ways to solve problems.

Currently, I'm working towards the completion of my program, but I'm trying to throw together a github page with my extremely limited html and jekyll knowledge!

Message me if you ever need something or want to collaborate, and I'll try my best to help!

You can reach me on discord at Parker#3354.
